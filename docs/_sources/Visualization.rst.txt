Visualization
=======================

In this module, we provide some simple scripts to show the representive structure in a cluster of structures. And show the transition pathway according to the flux after analyzing by the MSM module.


Show representive structure in a cluster of states
----------------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    python vmd_show.py -t traj.nc -p prmtop

- Trajectory file must be provided after ``-t`` argument, all the frames in a cluster are assembled in one trajectory file may have similar structures.
- Prmtop file must be provided after ``-p`` argument.
- The python script  call the ``vmd`` to show the representive structure. The gray lines represent different Backbone forms, and the Cartoon structure shows the center structure in this cluster. 

    .. image:: _static/representive.png
        :align: center
        :scale: 40%


Plot flux network
------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    python plot_network -i net_flux.txt -d .
    dot -Tpdf file.dot > file.pdf

- the net flux file should be provided after ``-i`` argument
- the image directory should be provided after ``-d`` argument
- The output file should use the ``dot`` command to output the image

    .. image:: _static/flux.png
        :align: center
- The arrow size may be look strange, and this can be modified by the *Adobe Illustrator* or *CorelDRAW*.
