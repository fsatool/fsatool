TPT
=================

In this module, the Transition Path Theory (TPT) analysis is implemented. :cite:`Noe2009`



`tpt` namelist
------------------

The tpt namelist has following parameters:

Necessary Parameters

--------------------

:tpmfile: **character** The transition probability matrix file which has the format of (ncluster * ncluster)
:statefile: **character** The state index file
:startstate: **integer** The index of start state of runing TPT analysis
:endstate: **integer** The index of end state of runing TPT analysis


Example
------------
The example of tpt namelist shows below ::

    &tpt
        tpmfile = "tpm.txt"
        statefile = "state.txt"
        startstate = 10
        endstate = 8
    /

Input File Format
-----------------

1. tpm.txt file format

========  =======  ===    =======
p_{11}    p_{12}   ...    p_{1n}
p_{21}    p_{22}   ...    p_{2n}
...       ...      ...     ...
p_{n1}    p_{n2}   ...    p_{nn}
========  =======  ===    =======

2. state file format (The states.txt file produced from MSM module can be used)

===========  ===============
state index  cluster index
===========  ===============
1             20
1             24
1             34
...           ...
2             41
2             89
...           ...
nstate        212
===========  ===============


Output File Format
------------------

*tpt.out* Transition path theory results, it's the net flux matrix from start state to end state which has a form of (number of state * number of state)

Run the `cluster` command
--------------------------

Default input file is "tpt.in"ï¼Œand default output file is "tpt.out"
The user can provide file by `-i` with input file, and `-o` with output file. 

.. code-block:: bash

    ./msm.x tpt
    ./msm.x tpt -i file.in -o file.out
