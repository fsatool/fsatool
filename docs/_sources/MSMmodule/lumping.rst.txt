Lumping
===================

The "PCCA+" and "BACE" method are supported to do the lumping (coarse grain)

`lumping` namelist
------------------

The `lumping` namelist has following parameters

    :nclsuter: **Integer** The number of microstates to perform lumping procedure
    :nstate: **Integer** The number of macrostates needs to be provided
    :lumpingmethod:  **character** Two methods "pccaplus" and "bace" are supported
    :datafile: **character**  If the `lumpingmethod` is "pccaplus", then the data file should contains the transition probability matrix. Else if the `lumpingmethod` is "bace", then the transtion count matrix should be provided

Example
-------------

The example of cluster namelist shows below ::

    &lumping
        datafile = "tpmlarge.txt"
        ncluster = 1000
        nstate = 8
        lumpingmethod = "pccaplus"
    /


Input File Format
-----------------

====   =====  ====   ====
P_00   P_01   ...    P_0n
P_10   P_11   ...    P_1n
P_20   P_21   ...    P_2n
...    ...    ...    ...
P_n0   P_n1   ...    P_nn
====   =====  ====   ====

    - **P_ij** : **double precision** When the "bace" method is used, the P_ij is the transition count from cluster i to cluster j.  When the "pccaplus" method is used, the P_ij is the transition probability from cluster i to cluster j. The file has `ncluster` lines, and for each line, there are `ncluster` numbers.

Output File Format
--------------------

For each line, there is a number corresponded to the macrostates index for each microstates


Run the `lumping` command
--------------------------

There are several ways to run the `lumping` command. Default input file is "lumping.in"ï¼Œand default output file is "lumping.out"
The user can provide file by `-i` with input file, and `-o` with output file. 

.. code-block:: bash

    ./msm.x lumping
    ./msm.x lumping -i file.in -o file.out
